### DAY 1-5 (14th Jan 2020 - 18th Jan 2020 )

1 Started to work on the images for the showcase section of the portfolio
2. Finished piecing together images and styling them.
3. Started to learn the bg colour change on scroll effect, but decided rather to lazy load the images since they are quite large.
4. Went through how to lazy load images in webpack, but decided to go for a library instead  (YALL.js)that uses the Intersect Observer API.
5. Built the cards for the Why Me section, using some undraw images.
