### 100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3 - [Alara Joel]

### Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [January 14th, Tuesday, 2020]


### DAY 1-5 (14th Jan 2020 - 18th Jan 2020 )

1 Started to work on the images for the showcase section of the portfolio

2. Finished piecing together images and styling them.

3. Started to learn the bg colour change on scroll effect, but decided rather to lazy load the images since they are quite large.

4. Went through how to lazy load images in webpack, but decided to go for a library instead  (YALL.js)that uses the Intersect Observer API.

5. Built the cards for the Why Me section, using some undraw images.



### DAY 6-10 (19th - 23rd Jan 2020 )

6. Worked through setting up lazy loading for large images, installed yall.js through npm.

7. Worked on the design for the contact section of my portfolio.

8. Learning how to make contact buttons functional, so they open necessary apps when clicked and also copy to clipboard

9.  Got the email and phone buttons functional, but not whatsapp.

10. Restructured contact form with an unordered list.



### DAY 11 -15 (24th - 28th Jan 2020)

11. Learnt how to properly align an icon with text using the vertical-align: middle CSS declaration

12. Hacked away at my portfolio, moving things around.

13. No coding.

14. worked on implementing smooth scroll for the navbar

15 Built a nice gradient effect on nav items with transitions.


### DAY 16 - 18 (29th - 31st Jan 2020)

16. No coding

17. I began some preps for my data science diploma with WorldQuant.

18. Learnt the major differences between SQl and NoSQL databases and which use cases each shine (SQL: Legacy systems, accounting data/system, NoSQL: real time analytics, big data, CMS).

### DAY 19 - 22 (1st - 4th February 2020)

19. Basics of coding with python for data science. Learnt on py data structures (float, string, integer, boolean), Conditionals (if statements), Iterations (while and for loops), Helper functions and methods.

20. No coding

21. Went deeper into py functions; 
Default args: setting arguments in such a way so when you do not supply them, they always have a value to fall back on,
*args: The arguments wildcard allows a function to have any number of arguments.

Learnt about the containers in py. Started with lists [] today and learnt a few methods needed to manipulate them (extend pop del pop) Lists are ordered, heterogeneous and mutable data structures.

Then tuples (): They are ordered, but immutable (Values cannot be changed) data structures. 

22. No coding.

### DAY 23 - 26

23 Learnt about another data structure called Sets. Sets are immutable and unordered, hence cannot be iterated, so to get values from them, you have to use a special function called a hashing function. 
Hashing means assigning boxes in memory based on the objects they contain

And then Dict (Dictionary). Dict in py is used to store data that consist of key-value pairs. 
You can merge other data structures to form dicts as long as they make logical meaning, using the Zip function.

24. Learnt about Memorization. which is used by dict to store the values of complex calculations, so we can later access them via our dicts. Hence we can use dicts as lookup tables.

Also about the Sort func which creates an ordered copy of an immutable data structure.

Finally learnt about comprehension which is a one-liner loop, used for simple iterative tasks.


25. No coding 

26. Learnt about collections. It is an extended library in python that gives us access to specialized data structures at little memory cost.
Deque (A double ended queue)
namedTuble (A tuple whose values have a reference).
Counter (A dict that counts the frequency of values in another dict)
defaultdict (Sets a return value when we reference non- existing keys in dicts).
