 DAY 1 #100daysofcode
 

I learnt some basics of JavaScript,  mostly variables and working with strings,  Using #freecodecamp basic JavaScript challenges. 
**A variable is a computer entity that can store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 

**A variable doesn't start with numbers nor contain spaces.

**Camel casing is the most intuitive naming conventions for programming e.g myVar.

**javascript can be used for basic arithmetic operations: + - / *

**A value can be incremented by using the ++ operator,  Or decremented by using the -- operator e.g i++ will simply add one on the next iteration. 

**If you want to include quotes in strings,  you can escape it using the / else the JavaScript compiler will throw an error. 

***Another reason to escape characters in a string is to allow you type characters that are usually restricted e.g the backslash // tab /t 

I also have been learning JavaScript for absolute beginners  by BoB Tabor on the side https://youtu.be/YMvzfQSI6pQ . So I'm kind of streghtning the knowledge I'm gaining there.  I still feel like a total noob in js but I know that will change. 
Still got two untouched projects on #freecodecamp Html and Css challenges. So hoping to begin building the technical documentation page tomorrow.


DAY 2 #100 Days Of Code


I went through more of the Basic Javascript challenges at https://learn.freecodecamp.org  while enjoying some nice collaborative coding with Naveen Kolambange who set up a slack channel for this purpose. We went through the part 1 of V. Anton Spraul's Think Like A Programmer series  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bkfA2fHVwg&list=PLKQ5LYb497AZIZe9dBWy8GwLluVaMQVj0&index=2. In summary I learnt to ask 2 questions when faced with a programing challege: What do i know how to do?
What is the question really asking for?
Also  never follow the obvious part alone, learn to experiment. 
Lastly I have sketched out how I want the Tech docs page project at FCC to look like 

**In javascript Concatenation of strings is done with the '+' operator: var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

**If you want to concatenate strings on multiple lines, you use '+=' operator:  ar ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";


**Strings can be created by constructing strings with other variables 

```var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";

var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
```

**If two variables contain strings, we can append them together: 

```anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
```

**Strings are immutable, the individual characters  of a string cannot be changed, you would have to change the entire string. 
 
 **To find the lenght of a string, you append .lenght after the string literal: "Alan Peter".length; // 10
 
 **Using bracket notation to find characters in strings(Understand that programming languages start counting charactyers from '0'):
 For nth:
 ```var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
  For last charater:var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
 ```
 
 DAY 3 #100 Days Of Code
 
Loading.....loading......error loading. There wasnt day 3 due to much activities and poor network I wasnt able to get any work done. Felt hurt but won't work myself up about it.
Would Focus on my technical documentation page tommorow.

DAY 3(repeat)  #100 Days Of Code

I spent quality time coding today. I was able to decide just what I want my technical documentation page project on FCC to look like. Building a React docs https://github.com/stealthman22/tech-doc-page/tree/master ...well of course i am copying most of their html ( I never said i was a react pro...well for now). So I am going to build either a landing page for it or an image slider. Also I learnt some amazing productivity hack in linux, for downloading batch video files check here: https://itsfoss.com/download-youtube-linux/ and https://youtu.be/dMXzoHTTvi0.

DAy 4

Put more work into the Html of my technical documentation page #freecodecamp.  Done with it now.  Over to basic stylings.  Will be using flexbox or grid.  Wonder if Just a simple landing page or a slider would be better. https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/pen/moxQjO

DAY 5

Learnt a lot about escaping HTML elements, which help you to render raw source code on your webpage eficiently without needing javascript. Yes it won't be as nice as the js approach with all its syntax highlighting; but it does get the job done. tHis online tool made it such a breeze through:https://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html. https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/pen/moxQjO


Day 6

Tinkering away still cannot seem to wrap my head around the css this time. I have forgotten quiet a number of things. 


Day 7
Finally getting myself css refreshed. Using variables to control my page's coloring.


Day 8

Still stuck at building the side nav. But i got two tutorials from youtube, and i am keenly going through them and getting the needed knowledge. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0uED-w9E48 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpGNFGqNfdU


Day 9

So everything was going on splendidly. Finally built the side nav bar and was tinkering for a bit. Then voila my navbar disappears in my editor but shows on my pen. https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/pen/moxQjO
Guess i will have to be coding from the pen now till i figure it out.

DAY 10

Really thought that i will finish this project today, turns out I broke my css code about twice and had to start again. 
At this pace, I will leave out the proposed landing page, and just get the content hide and unhide working.
https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/full/moxQjO

Also my nav-links seem to be missing their target most times.

Day 11

Learnt so much today about js
I got massive help from the #freeCodeCamp family and #stackoverflow.  Will have to change my <a> to buttons rather to help create the tab swiching triggers in js. 
Learning js is going to be a journey but im ready. 

 
 Day 12 (23rd March 2019)
Error... loading..... Fatal error. 
So i missed day 12.  It was a sober day for me.  Dad's good friend was buried.  

It's all good now.  Would cover up for the lag


Day 12 (repeat) (24th March 2019)

Today was good actually.  A gentleman helped me with the much needed js code to hide my page contents,  so it doesn't look so bloated.  
Also got my html links to work smoothly.  Turns out it's better you nest the <a> in the <li>. 
 
 Day 13 (25th March 2019)
 
Finally it's done. And it's not the best thing ever, I am quite proud of this project. Thanks to Micheal Aubrey from freecodecamp for his massive js input. 1 thing tho; my nav links won't move without the onclick functions i initially added.
 Don't sweat the small stuffs learn more and make steady progress, it will all come together.

Day 14 (26th March 2019)

Got a lot of feedback on my completed project. One word; IMPROVE. Started gathering resources for color theory and design. I want to be better at this. Would love to get more resources reccomendations. Did a bit of the js challenges at FCC. I was feeling a bit ill all day.
