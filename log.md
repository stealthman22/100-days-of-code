 DAY 1 #100daysofcode
 

I learnt some basics of JavaScript,  mostly variables and working with strings,  Using #freecodecamp basic JavaScript challenges. 

I also have been learning JavaScript for absolute beginners  by BoB Tabor on the side https://youtu.be/YMvzfQSI6pQ . So I'm kind of streghtning the knowledge I'm gaining there.  I still feel like a total noob in js but I know that will change. 
Still got two untouched projects on #freecodecamp Html and Css challenges. So hoping to begin building the technical documentation page tomorrow.


DAY 2 #100 Days Of Code


I went through more of the Basic Javascript challenges at https://learn.freecodecamp.org  while enjoying some nice collaborative coding with Naveen Kolambange who set up a slack channel for this purpose. We went through the part 1 of V. Anton Spraul's Think Like A Programmer series  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bkfA2fHVwg&list=PLKQ5LYb497AZIZe9dBWy8GwLluVaMQVj0&index=2. 

In summary I learnt to ask 2 questions when faced with a programing challege: What do i know how to do?
What is the question really asking for?
Also  never follow the obvious part alone, learn to experiment. 
Lastly I have sketched out how I want the Tech docs page project at FCC to look like 


 
 DAY 3 #100 Days Of Code
 
Loading.....loading......error loading. There wasnt day 3 due to much activities and poor network I wasnt able to get any work done. Felt hurt but won't work myself up about it.
Would Focus on my technical documentation page tommorow.

DAY 3(repeat)  #100 Days Of Code

I spent quality time coding today. I was able to decide just what I want my technical documentation page project on FCC to look like. Building a React docs https://github.com/stealthman22/tech-doc-page/tree/master ...well of course i am copying most of their html ( I never said i was a react pro...well for now). So I am going to build either a landing page for it or an image slider. Also I learnt some amazing productivity hack in linux, for downloading batch video files check here: https://itsfoss.com/download-youtube-linux/ and https://youtu.be/dMXzoHTTvi0.

DAy 4

Put more work into the Html of my technical documentation page #freecodecamp.  Done with it now.  Over to basic stylings.  Will be using flexbox or grid.  Wonder if Just a simple landing page or a slider would be better. https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/pen/moxQjO

DAY 5

Learnt a lot about escaping HTML elements, which help you to render raw source code on your webpage eficiently without needing javascript. Yes it won't be as nice as the js approach with all its syntax highlighting; but it does get the job done. tHis online tool made it such a breeze through:https://www.freeformatter.com/html-escape.html. https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/pen/moxQjO


Day 6

Tinkering away still cannot seem to wrap my head around the css this time. I have forgotten quiet a number of things. 


Day 7
Finally getting myself css refreshed. Using variables to control my page's coloring.


Day 8

Still stuck at building the side nav. But i got two tutorials from youtube, and i am keenly going through them and getting the needed knowledge. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0uED-w9E48 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpGNFGqNfdU


Day 9

So everything was going on splendidly. Finally built the side nav bar and was tinkering for a bit. Then voila my navbar disappears in my editor but shows on my pen. https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/pen/moxQjO
Guess i will have to be coding from the pen now till i figure it out.

DAY 10

Really thought that i will finish this project today, turns out I broke my css code about twice and had to start again. 
At this pace, I will leave out the proposed landing page, and just get the content hide and unhide working.
https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/full/moxQjO

Also my nav-links seem to be missing their target most times.

Day 11

Learnt so much today about js
I got massive help from the #freeCodeCamp family and #stackoverflow.  Will have to change my <a> to buttons rather to help create the tab swiching triggers in js. 
Learning js is going to be a journey but im ready. 

 
 Day 12 (23rd March 2019)
Error... loading..... Fatal error. 
So i missed day 12.  It was a sober day for me.  Dad's good friend was buried.  

It's all good now.  Would cover up for the lag


Day 12 (repeat) (24th March 2019)

Today was good actually.  A gentleman helped me with the much needed js code to hide my page contents,  so it doesn't look so bloated.  
Also got my html links to work smoothly.  Turns out it's better you nest the <a> in the <li>. 
 
 Day 13 (25th March 2019)
 
Finally it's done. And it's not the best thing ever, I am quite proud of this project. Thanks to Micheal Aubrey from freecodecamp for his massive js input. 1 thing tho; my nav links won't move without the onclick functions i initially added.
 Don't sweat the small stuffs learn more and make steady progress, it will all come together.

Day 14 (26th March 2019)

Got a lot of feedback on my completed project. One word; IMPROVE. Started gathering resources for color theory and design. I want to be better at this. Would love to get more resources reccomendations. Did a bit of the js challenges at FCC. I was feeling a bit ill all day.



Day 15 (27th March 2019)


Did more of the js challenges @ Fcc. Js is all starting to make sense now. Getting my resources for color and design ready. The deep dive is imminent. Found this wonderful youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog I think this will level me up in css.
 

 
 Day 16 (28th March 2019)
 
 More input to the js challenges at FCC. JS is absolutely tricky and challenging, but I think it wields an unrivalled power.
 Went through more of Online Tutorials CSS designs on youtube and I am absolutely blown away. 
Still prepping for the color theory and design theory deep dive. No rush, taking things slow.


Day 17 (29th march 2019)

These js challenges are really getting interesting. i learnt a bit about golf in on the js challenges. Very funny indeed.
Started reaing a bit on color theory. It sounds a bit abstract, but I will give it time.

Day 18 (30th March 2019)

Did some more js challenges today. Was so tired and was virtually dozing all through the challenges. One thing I learnt; the earler in the day you get some work done, the better.

Day 19 (31st March 2019)

Okay took a break from the js challenges at FCC. Started working of my design eye..lol. I have began working on ONline tutorial's design lessons. Built something nice. Hover and see: https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/full/eomNzK

Day 20 (1st April 2019 )

The js challenges were really seeming quite elusive today, I have to really start studying more js.Knocked down another design lesson by  http://www.onlinetutorialsweb.com. link is at https://codepen.io/alara_joel_stealth/full/YMPpay.
Reading code is as important as writing them.

Day 21 (2nd April 2019)

More js challenges. Did another Css design tutorial, didn't quite get it but I will work on it more. 
Got some issues with adding smooth transitions to animations

Day 22 (3rd April 2019)

Ya so I missed today, deliberately too. I needed to take a step back and reevaluate. What am I doing wrong? How far have I come? How can I get better?. I tried to prepare a goal oriented time table so I can push myself more and make the best of my time and efforts.

Day 22 (Repeat 4th April 2019)

Worked on js challenges on FCC. Yop my js still sucks.I had a great time studying Laura Elizabeth's 'A Simple Web Developer's Color Guide' on Smashing magazine. She made it all look simple. Also worked through a CSS tutorial by  http://www.onlinetutorialsweb.com Didn't quite catch it, but will work more on it tommorow.   


Day 23 (5th April 2019)

Started reading JavaScript grammer today, it is all modern, I guess it is better to study js the new way rather than re invent the wheel. Learnt and documented a css solution for navbar content targetting (by Micheal Aubrey at FCC). Did a bit of the js challenges at FCC. 


DAY 24 (6th April 2019)
Still trying to get comfy with the js world. Did more of Freecodecamp's js challenges. This ES6 syntax makes my head tingle nice.


DAY 25  (7th April 2019)
Got back home super late. Thanks to these tropical torrential downpour. So I sat down to code, struggled for 40 minutes with a sleepy eye, Couldn't help it and dozed of. Let's reset for tommorow.
