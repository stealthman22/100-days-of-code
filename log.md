DAY 1
Day 1 #100daysofcode
I learnt some basics of JavaScript,  mostly variables and working with strings,  Using #freecodecamp basic JavaScript challenges. 
**A variable Is a computer entity that can store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 

**A variable doesn't start with numbers nor contain spaces.

**Camel casing is the most intuitive naming conventions for programming e.g myVar. *javascript can be used for basic arithmetic operations: + - / *

**A value can be incremented by using the ++ operator,  Or decremented by using the -- operator e.g i++ will simply add one on the next iteration. *If you want to include quotes in strings,  you can escape it using the / else the JavaScript compiler will throw an error. 

***Another reason to escape characters in a string is to allow you type characters that are usually restricted e.g the backslash // tab /t 

I also have been learning JavaScript for absolute beginners  by BoB Tabor on the side. So I'm kind of streghtning the knowledge I'm gaining there.  I still feel like a total noob in js but I know that will change. 
Still got two untouched projects on #freecodecamp Html and Css challenges. So hoping to begin building the technical documentation page tomorrow.


DAY 2
I went through more of the Basic Javascript challenges at https://learn.freecodecamp.org  while enjoying some nice collaborative coding with Naveen Kolambange who set up a slack channel for this purpose. We went throuhh the part 1 of V Anton Spraul's Think Like A Programmer series  at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bkfA2fHVwg&list=PLKQ5LYb497AZIZe9dBWy8GwLluVaMQVj0&index=2. In summary I learnt to ask 2 questions when faced with a programing challege: What do i know how to do?
What is the question really asking for?
Also  never follow the obvious part alone, learn to experiment. 
Lastly I have sketched out how I want the Tech docs page project at FCC to look like 

**In javascript Concatenation of strings is done with the '+' operator: var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

**If you want to concatenate strings on multiple lines, you use '+=' operator:  ar ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";


**Strings can be created by constructing strings with other variables var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
```var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
```

**If two variables contain strings, we can append them together:  anAdjective = "awesome!";
```var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
```
 ** Strings are immutable, the individual characters  of a string cannot be changed, you would have to change the entire string. 
 
 **To find the lenght of a string, you append .lenght after the string literal: "Alan Peter".length; // 10
 
 **Using bracket notation to find characters in strings(Understand that programming languages start counting charactyers from '0'):
 For nth:```var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
  For last charater:var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];
 ```
