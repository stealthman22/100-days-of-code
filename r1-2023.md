## Day 1 -2 (7th - 8th Jan)

Finished up Week 0 (Scratch ) and progressed in Week 1 (Intro to C) of the CS50 courseware.
And I find It insightful. 
I hope to be able to set aside more study time, for cs50 and also for web development

## Day 3 (9th Jan)
I finished week 1 lectures in #CS50, now moving on to my first problem set.
Learnt a ton of things:
Integer overflow,, Type casting, the concept of HOF in js. 
it's interesting because even though I am learning C, I am understanding js better
