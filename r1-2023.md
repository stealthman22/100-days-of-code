## Day 1 -2 (7th - 8th Jan)
Finished up Week 0 (Scratch ) and progressed in Week 1 (Intro to C) of the CS50 courseware.
And I find It insightful. 
I hope to be able to set aside more study time, for cs50 and also for web development

## Day 3 (9th Jan)
I finished week 1 lectures in #CS50, now moving on to my first problem set.
Learnt a ton of things:
Integer overflow,, Type casting, the concept of HOF in js. 
it's interesting because even though I am learning C, I am understanding js better

## Day 4 - 6 (10th - 12th Jan)
I finished all supplementary  lectures for week 1 and  have been working on the practice questions, done with two of them, left with one, and then I will tackle the problem sets for week 1. Also started my adv css course.


### Day 7 (13th Jan )

Got stuck on one of my practice questions, it had to do with printing out the prime numbers in a range of numbers.



### Day 8 (15th )
I was busy teaching someone HTML today, so  I couldn't get around my studies. We had an excellent theory class on CS, the internet and web development.

### Day 9 - 10 (16th - 17th)

Super busy collating study materials for some friends and not able to study, I have to do a better job of time management, so I get better.


Day 11 - 18 (18th - 25th January  )

Still working on cs50. currently done with the labs for week 1, I am left with the problem sets, 4 questions of which I have to submit two, the focus is algorithms. I have to do better with my time management.
