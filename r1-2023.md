# We Begin today 7th January 2023


## Day 1 -2 (7th - 8th Jan)
Finished up Week 0 (Scratch ) and progressed in Week 1 (Intro to C) of the CS50 courseware.
And I find It insightful. 
I hope to be able to set aside more study time, for cs50 and also for web development
#100DaysOfCode #cs50


## Day 3 (9th Jan)
I finished week 1 lectures in #CS50, now moving on to my first problem set.
Learnt a ton of things:
Integer overflow,, Type casting, the concept of HOF in js. 
it's interesting because even though I am learning C, I am understanding js better

## Day 4 - 6 (10th - 12th Jan)
I finished all supplementary  lectures for week 1 and  have been working on the practice questions, done with two of them, left with one, and then I will tackle the problem sets for week 1. Also started my adv css course.


### Day 7 (13th Jan )

Got stuck on one of my practice questions, it had to do with printing out the prime numbers in a range of numbers.



### Day 8 (15th )
I was busy teaching someone HTML today, so  I couldn't get around my studies. We had an excellent theory class on CS, the internet and web development.

### Day 9 - 10 (16th - 17th)

Super busy collating study materials for some friends and not able to study, I have to do a better job of time management, so I get better.


Day 11 - 18 (18th - 25th January  )

Still working on cs50. currently done with the labs for week 1, I am left with the problem sets, 4 questions of which I have to submit two, the focus is algorithms. I have to do better with my time management.


### Day 19 - 21 (26th - 29th  January)

I finally solved one of the questions for the problem sets of wk 1, I am trying not to rush this and do all i can until I can't anymore before i chekc on google and stack overflow. C is so different from js and super strict

I really do not understand nested for loops

### Day 22 (25th April)

I started Jonas Sccmetman advanced css and sass course, learnt how to use the clip part property, and discovered that the css background image property can contain both a gradient and image at the same time.

###Day 23-25 (1st - 3rd May)
I have been working on the adv CSS course, and have learnt how to properly work with CSS animations using keyframes and transitions. also been working on freecodecamp's Js certification  (regular expressions). Been working on a project too with WordPress for a client, and I am so glad Elementor finally added Flexbox containers.

### Day 26-27 (14th - 15th May)
Been building my new React portfolio site, and also building a website for a client (built with WordPress), I've been fatigued lately, but still moving. I hope soon I really get a hang of react


### Day 26-27 (22nd - 24th May)

I have been working on transitioning to WSL, rather than my current dual boot setup. I have mixed feelings about it, but it would be a better fit for me, at least at the moment, so I have all coding  and creative apps I need in one place. LINUX rules all day. Good job to windows on WSL tho
