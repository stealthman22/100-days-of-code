## Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]


## Recap of round 4

Learnt so much about full stack development. Had my fair share of frustrating moments.. But it is so shocking how much I have grown from day 1 to day 100
Manipulated so much backend routes, built my own logic, learnt how to use ES-lint...........


### Day 1 (Dec 21st 2020)

Finished cleaning up the backend routes for my client's web app. Still have to build the profile pic upload logic, won't be using gravatar anymore (unless I change my mind). Would start the front end for now.
