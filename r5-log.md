## Recap of round 4

Learnt so much about full stack development. Had my fair share of frustrating moments.. But it is so shocking how much I have grown from day 1 to day 100
Manipulated so much backend routes, built my own logic, learnt how to use ES-lint...........


### Day 1 (Dec 21st 2020)

Finished cleaning up the backend routes for my client's web app. Still have to build the profile pic upload logic, won't be using gravatar anymore (unless I change my mind). Would start the front end for now.


### Day 2 (Jan 4th 2021)

Built two components (sign up and sign in page) on my client's web app. Also set up redux. Currently have an alert reducer well setup across the application state.
Redux is still kinda crazy to me, but I am beginning to get it and appreciate it.




### Day 3 (Jan 5th 2021)

Went deeper into redux and built the whole logic for signing in and out, loading user and clearing the app state at appropriate times.
Had some hard time with Eslint errors. 
Learnt to set global headers in Axios, and use the UUID package.



### Day 4 (Jan 6th 2021)

Built states to authenticate a user  signing in, check if the user has a profile, clear their 
Been doing a lot with the ternary operator using the short-circuiting style. 
Also built protected routes with React router. A nice approach I must say


### DAY 5 (Jan 7th 2021)

Built component to create profile and dashboard.
The major challenge is that there are supposed to be 3 different create profile components depending on their role during registration. Can't wait to do that tomorrow
