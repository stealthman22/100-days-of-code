100DaysOfCode Log - Round 4 - [Alara Joel]
Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]


# DAY 0
Been working on the complete javascript course by jonas schmedtman  and am about to round up the fundamentals pt 1, and it is solidifying my js knowledge. Also resumed my FCC js track; topics I'm currently trying to wrap my mind around include; recursion, objects

## Side notes

It's been a bit of unsteadiness when it comes to my focus, and expectations lately, but I refuse to lose track, rather, I'm back to the thinking table to re-evaluate and introspect.
Few things I have learnt to factor into my learning and skillset include;  
what's the tech focus in my vicinity?
What would the tech focus be in the nearest future?
What is my goal; be hired or freelance, or both?
What is my vision? that is, what are my goals beyond right now.

Taken some interesting decisions and endeavours which I'd unveil with time.

Me going back to my fundamentals at such a crucial time might seem aimless, but it will surely prove to be career-saving!

Stay Tuned Guys!




# Day 1 (16th Spet 2021)
Been working on js fundamental concepts, rounded up with function fundamentals, took a while to get how data is passed from one funtion to another, but i got it now. Started with array fundamentals, The Dot and Bracket notaions


# Js fundamentals revised so far:
- Data Types
- Variable declarations
- Operators
- Operator Precedence
- Type Coercion
- Truthy Falsy
- Conditionals 
- Switch Statements
- Statements Vs Expressions.
- The ternary operator
- The Strict mood
- Functions 
- Funtion declarations vs Function expressions
- Arrow functions
- Calling functions from within other funtions 
- Arguments Vs Parameters
- Arrays 
- Zero based counting
- Dot Notation vs  Brakcet Notation
- Template Literals
- 





### Day 2 (17th September 2021)
Learnt some basic array methods (methods are like in-built functions that perform certain actions on arrays).
Unshift,  Push (add items to the arrays), Pop, shift (removes items), indexOf (returns items position) and Include (returns true or false).

Also learnt a bit on Objects, their anatomy and how to access their items (dot and bracket notation)

### Day 3 (18th Sept 2021)
Did an intro to objects, and learnt the key difference between accessing their items with the dot or bracket notation. 
 bracket notation:  the property is referred to as a string.
 dot notation: use the real final property name, and not a computed property name


### Day 4 (19th september 2021)
MISSED


### Day 5 (20th September 2021)

Learnt about methods in js objects. In every object method, javascript gives us access to a special variable called this. The this variable is equal to the object on which the method is called.



Made my first js joke. hahah 



### Day 6 - 9
Learnt about fucntions and methods and also the this keyword
missed day 8 and 9



### Day 10 - 11
Learnt it is possible to create an object  method in another method, rather than explicitly specifying it
Also learnt the intricacies of for loops and while loops


### Day 12 - 13
Went deeper into while loops, also learnt the math.trucn() function.


### Day 14-15
 Had a bug that made me look deeper into the concept of implicit return in arrow fucntions. Once curly braces surround a funtion body, return statement must be specified.
 
 
 ### Day 16
 
 Was stuck on a while loop challenge, but finally got it working well, definitely learning new ways to do things in javascript.
 
 
 ### Day 17 - 18 (1-2 october 2021)
 learnt on the 4 steps to problem solving as a developer
 
 1.Discover the bugs
 2. Isolate where the bug is In the code
 3. Fix the bug
 4. Prevent the bug from occuring again,
 
 
 ### Day 19 -21
 Missed
 
 
 Day 22 (6th Ocotber 2021)
 solved a challenge thats been bugging me, learnt how to grab the index on items in an array using the indexOf the operator. at first I used to mix up the index and the actual array item.
 
 
 Day 23 (7th October 2021)
 Studied the problem solving framework
 1.  Understand the problem 100%: Ask the right questions
2. Divide and conquer: break into sub-problems
3. Do as much research as you need to (Google, SO, MDN )
4. For bigger problems write pseudo-code
 
 
 Day 24 (8th)
I worked through a challenge that is a bit difficult, not sure how to return a single string comprising of all the values from a for loop, I end up printing the last occurrence to the console.
 

Day 25 - 26 (Missed)

Day 27 (11th October 2021)

Finally solved the hard challenge. what i learnt.
* How to accumulate the values returned from a for loop into a single string using the += operator.
* when you initialize a var, it will returned undefined unless set to an empty string.
