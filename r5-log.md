100DaysOfCode Log - Round 4 - [Alara Joel]
Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]


# DAY 0
Been working on the complete javascript course by jonas schmedtman  and am about to round up the fundamentals pt 1, and it is solidifying my js knowledge. Also resumed my FCC js track; topics I'm currently trying to wrap my mind around include; recursion, objects

## Side notes

It's been a bit of unsteadiness when it comes to my focus, and expectations lately, but I refuse to lose track, rather, I'm back to the thinking table to re-evaluate and introspect.
Few things I have learnt to factor into my learning and skillset include;  
what's the tech focus in my vicinity?
What would the tech focus be in the nearest future?
What is my goal; be hired or freelance, or both?
What is my vision? that is, what are my goals beyond right now.

Taken some interesting decisions and endeavours which I'd unveil with time.

Me going back to my fundamentals at such a crucial time might seem aimless, but it will surely prove to be career-saving!

Stay Tuned Guys!




# Day 1 (16th Spet 2021)
Been working on js fundamental concepts, rounded up with function fundamentals, took a while to get how data is passed from one funtion to another, but i got it now. Started with array fundamentals, The Dot and Bracket notaions

### Day 2 (17th September 2021)
Learnt some basic array methods (methods are like in-built functions that perform certain actions on arrays).
Unshift,  Push (add items to the arrays), Pop, shift (removes items), indexOf (returns items position) and Include (returns true or false).

Also learnt a bit on Objects, their anatomy and how to access their items (dot and bracket notation)

### Day 3 (18th Sept 2021)
Did an intro to objects, and learnt the key difference between accessing their items with the dot or bracket notation. 
 bracket notation:  the property is referred to as a string.
 dot notation: use the real final property name, and not a computed property name


### Day 4 (19th september 2021)
MISSED


### Day 5 (20th September 2021)

Learnt about methods in js objects. In every object method, javascript gives us access to a special variable called this. The this variable is equal to the object on which the method is called.



Made my first js joke. hahah
