# DAY 0
Been working on the complete javascript course by jonas schmedtman  and am about to round up the fundamentals pt 1, and it is solidifying my js knowledge. Also resumed my FCC js track; topics I'm currently trying to wrap my mind around include; recursion, objects

## Side notes

It's been a bit of unsteadiness when it comes to my focus, and expectations lately, but I refuse to lose track, rather, I'm back to the thinking table to re-evaluate and introspect.
Few things I have learnt to factor into my learning and skillset include;  
what's the tech focus in my vicinity?
What would the tech focus be in the nearest future?
What is my goal; be hired or freelance, or both?
What is my vision? that is, what are my goals beyond right now.

Taken some interesting decisions and endeavours which I'd unveil with time.

Me going back to my fundamentals at such a crucial time might seem aimless, but it will surely prove to be career-saving!

Stay Tuned Guys!
