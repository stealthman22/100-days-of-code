## Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]


## Recap of round 4

Learnt so much about full stack development. Had my fair share of frustrating moments.. But it is so shocking how much I have grown from day 1 to day 100
Manipulated so much backend routes, built my own logic, learnt how to use ES-lint...........


### Day 1 (Dec 21st 2020)

Finished cleaning up the backend routes for my client's web app. Still have to build the profile pic upload logic, won't be using gravatar anymore (unless I change my mind). Would start the front end for now.


### Day 2 (Jan 4th 2021)

Built two components (sign up and sign in page) on my client's web app. Also set up redux. Currently have an alert reducer well setup across the application state.
Redux is still kinda crazy to me, but I am beginning to get it and appreciate it.
