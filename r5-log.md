100DaysOfCode Log - Round 4 - [Alara Joel]
Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]


# DAY 0
Been working on the complete javascript course by jonas schmedtman  and am about to round up the fundamentals pt 1, and it is solidifying my js knowledge. Also resumed my FCC js track; topics I'm currently trying to wrap my mind around include; recursion, objects

## Side notes

It's been a bit of unsteadiness when it comes to my focus, and expectations lately, but I refuse to lose track, rather, I'm back to the thinking table to re-evaluate and introspect.
Few things I have learnt to factor into my learning and skillset include;  
what's the tech focus in my vicinity?
What would the tech focus be in the nearest future?
What is my goal; be hired or freelance, or both?
What is my vision? that is, what are my goals beyond right now.

Taken some interesting decisions and endeavours which I'd unveil with time.

Me going back to my fundamentals at such a crucial time might seem aimless, but it will surely prove to be career-saving!

Stay Tuned Guys!




# Day 1 (16th Spet 2021)
Been working on js fundamental concepts, rounded up with function fundamentals, took a while to get how data is passed from one funtion to another, but i got it now. Started with array fundamentals, The Dot and Bracket notaions


# Js fundamentals revised so far:
- Data Types
- Variable declarations
- Operators
- Operator Precedence
- Type Coercion
- Truthy Falsy
- Conditionals 
- Switch Statements
- Statements Vs Expressions.
- The ternary operator
- The Strict mood
- Functions 
- Funtion declarations vs Function expressions
- Arrow functions
- Calling functions from within other funtions 
- Arguments Vs Parameters
- Arrays 
- Zero based counting
- Dot Notation vs  Brakcet Notation
- Template Literals
- 





### Day 2 (17th September 2021)
Learnt some basic array methods (methods are like in-built functions that perform certain actions on arrays).
Unshift,  Push (add items to the arrays), Pop, shift (removes items), indexOf (returns items position) and Include (returns true or false).

Also learnt a bit on Objects, their anatomy and how to access their items (dot and bracket notation)

### Day 3 (18th Sept 2021)
Did an intro to objects, and learnt the key difference between accessing their items with the dot or bracket notation. 
 bracket notation:  the property is referred to as a string.
 dot notation: use the real final property name, and not a computed property name


### Day 4 (19th september 2021)
MISSED


### Day 5 (20th September 2021)

Learnt about methods in js objects. In every object method, javascript gives us access to a special variable called this. The this variable is equal to the object on which the method is called.



Made my first js joke. hahah 



### Day 6 - 9
Learnt about fucntions and methods and also the this keyword
missed day 8 and 9



### Day 10 - 11
Learnt it is possible to create an object  method in another method, rather than explicitly specifying it
Also learnt the intricacies of for loops and while loops


### Day 12 - 13
Went deeper into while loops, also learnt the math.trucn() function.


### Day 14-15
 Had a bug that made me look deeper into the concept of implicit return in arrow fucntions. Once curly braces surround a funtion body, return statement must be specified.
 
 
 ### Day 16
 
 Was stuck on a while loop challenge, but finally got it working well, definitely learning new ways to do things in javascript.
 
 
 ### Day 17 - 18 (1-2 october 2021)
 learnt on the 4 steps to problem solving as a developer
 
 1.Discover the bugs
 2. Isolate where the bug is In the code
 3. Fix the bug
 4. Prevent the bug from occuring again,
 
 
 ### Day 19 -21
 Missed
 
 
 Day 22 (6th Ocotber 2021)
 solved a challenge thats been bugging me, learnt how to grab the index on items in an array using the indexOf the operator. at first I used to mix up the index and the actual array item.
 
 
 Day 23 (7th October 2021)
 Studied the problem solving framework
 1.  Understand the problem 100%: Ask the right questions
2. Divide and conquer: break into sub-problems
3. Do as much research as you need to (Google, SO, MDN )
4. For bigger problems write pseudo-code
 
 
 Day 24 (8th)
I worked through a challenge that is a bit difficult, not sure how to return a single string comprising of all the values from a for loop, I end up printing the last occurrence to the console.
 

Day 25 - 26 (Missed)

Day 27 (11th October 2021)

Finally solved the hard challenge. what i learnt.
* How to accumulate the values returned from a for loop into a single string using the += operator.
* when you initialize a var, it will returned undefined unless set to an empty string.



Day 28 (12th October 2021)

Started with DOM manipulatin in javascript.
DOM is an API that consists of a  structured representation of HTML that allows js to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
Used propteris like .textContent and .value



Day 29 (13th October 2021)

Learnt how to handle events, manipulate CSS styles via the DOM and also code refactoring. And built a guessing game.



DAY 30 (14th October 2021)



### RECAP : DAY 30 - 48
Concluded parts of the DOM section of my js course learnt how to handle events via the event callback function, and worked through a more comprehensive project, missed quite a couple of days in between. would really work on my consistency as it is key.



### DAY 40
Learning how js works behind the scene, did an over-view on core abilities and xteristics of language :
Highlevel, Garbage collected, both compiled(just in time) and interpreted. multiparadigm, prototype based. 
 First class fucntions dynamiccally typed, single threaded with a non-blocking event loop

### Day 60 (long update)

sorry for no updates.
I have finished the js theory lectures, took a while to assimilate them. Also been doing some extra things, built a ladning page for a company I might be doing a thing with soon, and also did some copy designs too.
WOuld work on being more regular from now on


### Day 60 (23rd NOvember)

I learnt about destructuring and used it for array.
Destructuring is a way of unpacking array/object values into individual variables. i.e breaking a complex data strructure into simpler data strucutres.
Destruc does not mutate arrays.
 we can set default values for vars when destruc, useful when we do not know the lenght of the data coming in 
 
 
 
 
 ### Day 61 (24th Nov )
 I went deeper into destructuring with objects and learnt how to:
Destructure Objects;
With default values
With different names from their property name
That is nested
Also learnt a complex technique where we pass an object as param to a method, and when we call the method with an obj it is destructured immediately by the method.


FInally started learning about the spread operators, which unpacks items from arrays, without creating new variables



 ### Day 63 -(25th)
 
 Rounded up destructuring with objects, By default objects are destructured with their exact property name as variables, to create new variables for them, you use the key-pair value syntax to rename them.
 Also, we can destructure, right in a function call, as soon as the call happens, the vars are unpacked and passed in as arguments.
 
 ### Day 64 (26th NOv) Learnt the spread operator, it is used to unpack arrays into its individual items. The spread operator works on all iterables except Objects. It is mostly used when building arrays, or passing values in a function.  It provides an easy syntax to create shallow copies of arrays, and join 2 or more arrays together.
 
 
 ### DAY 65 (27th NOv)
Learnt about the  Rest pattern which uses a spread-like syntax, but does the opposite of spread; it collects different values and packs them into an array. it is placed on the left side of an assignment (spread is mostly on the right)
if you plan to use rest in a destruc. syntax, it must be the last variable declared. else it would throw an error
 There can be only one rest parameter in a destruc.
 
 ### DAY 66 (28th Nov)
 
 Using the logical operators AND OR, we can create a special type of conditional called a SHORT CIRCUIT.  it simply means during a comparison, if the current value evaluates to be true, returns it immediately. For  OR once it meets a true value, it evaluates to true. For AND once a single value is false, the operation equates to false.
 
 ROunded up with the new Nullish Coalescing Operator. The NC Operator uses nullish values rather than falsy values. So if  a value of zero happens to be truth, it would evaluate it to true
 
 
 
 
 ### Day 67 - 68 (29th - 30th Nov)
 
 Learnt on the FOR OF loop it is a new way of looping over arrays,  it automatically loops over the element and on each iteration, it gives us access to the current array element. To get access to the index is a bit tricky, we must call the entries method on the array. Also learnt of "ENHANCED OBJECT LIREALS which makes it a bit easier to work with objects.  ROunded up with the LOGICAL ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR; it provides a concise syntax for creating default values when with logical operators. (||= assigns a value to a variable if it is currently falsy 
 &&= assigns a value to a variable if it is currently truthy)
 
 
## DAY 69 - 70 missed


DAY 71 (3rd december)

Learnt on OPTIONAL CHAINING; It can be used if we are not so sure a property exists on an object, if the property is absent it returns undefined rather than break out of the code. It also works with arrays to check if they are empty.
It is often used together with the nullish COalesing operator


### Day 72 (4th devember)
Learnt how to properly loop over objects.
Objects are not iterable so they can't be looped over directly. but by using the Object constructor alongside the keys (only keys), entries(both keys and values) and values (only values) methods, we can pull what's needed from the original object and return them in an array. This array can now be looped over using the for-of loop


### DAY 73 missed

### DAY 74 - 75

Completed coding challenges involving looping over objects.
learnt about the /= operator
Leant about sets in javascript. Sets are data structures that hold unique values, which means sets cannot have duplicates. 
We can add and  delete elements from  sets clear it, and loop over it
A practical use case of sets is to remove duplicates from an array, with the spread operator


### DAY 76
I learnt about Map in Js. A map is a data structure that can be used to map values to keys.  With maps, the keys can be any type (in object keys are mostly strings).  it is very easy to convert Objects to maps using entries method on the object. We can convert map to array, using the spread operator.
Maps are iterables, hence we can loop over them directly as we would with arrays.
  
  ### DAY 77
Arrays vs Sets: Use arrays when you want to store values in order and they might also contain duplicates, use sets when you want unique values. Also, use arrays when you would be doing a lot of manipulations, but use sets when high performance is needed. 

Objects vs Maps
Use maps when you need to map keys to values and when you need keys that are not strings.  Use Objets when you need to include functions (methods) and  when you are working with JSON (you can convert later to Maps).

### Day 78
working on the looping over maps challenge, and I am stuck trying to mutate a map. First time I have had a challenge so difficult in this course, if I don't crack it by tomorrow, I'd just move on

### DAY 79
Missed 

### DAY 80 (13th december 2021)
Succesfully finished the Map challenges; learnt about the at() method of arrays, to return the element at a particular index.
Started learning on Strings. They  are iterable, hence can be indexed. Also you can use slice to return a part of a string. It is impossible to mutate strings becuase they are primitives


DAY 81 - 85 (14th - 18th  December)
A long gruesome study into string manipulations in javascript. And just as I was about to post, I lost the notes (like everything, 4 days worth of work).

Methods I learnt to use are:
• indexOf (get the index of a char)
• lastIndexOg (get the index of the last occurrence of a char)
• slice (return a part of a string from a specific point)
• toUpperCase and toLowerCase
• trim: remove white space from the front and end of a string
• startsWith and endsWith: checks If a string starts or ends with specified char.
• split: divides a string bases on criteria, and returns the items in an array
• join: takes items in an array and joins them to a single string
• repeat: repeats a char, by a specified number

strings are primitives, hence methods should not be called on them, for this to happen, the js engine converts the primitive string to  a String object, runs the computation and converts the output back to a primitive string


DAY 86 (1st January 2022)Studied default functions today. It can set default values for arguments that aren't passed into a function, useful when there is a common value expected. They can be set to ternary operators or any other expressions, hence are very flexible.


DAY 87
The first-class function is a concept in programming languages that functions are just treated as values. In practice, this translates to a fnc  ability to be  ]a higher-order fnc (accepting a fnc as an argument), or return another function.




### Day 88 (may 24th 2022)
Revised the call bind and apply methods of functions. started a new challenge. Found out that you cannot evaluate Nan using the equality operator
if and === Nan doesn't work. YOu have to use the isNan function for evaluations like this to be correct.
Started making Anki flashcards to solidify my code knowledge, it's really a slow transition to this style of learning, and building your own cards can be hard but I am determined not to stop.
