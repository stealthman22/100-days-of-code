# Plegding to embark on a 100 Days of Code Journey from 23rd September 2024


## Day 1
I started with the Cs50p course today. I decided not to skip any part even though I already know some basic Python.  I started with functions today and wrote a Hello World program. Some keywords I learnt today include  Function, argument, bugs, debugging, variables and comments.
