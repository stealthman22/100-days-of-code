# Plegding to embark on a 100 Days of Code Journey from 23rd September 2024


## Day 1 (24th September 2024)
I started with the Cs50p course today. I decided not to skip any part even though I already know some basic Python.  I started with functions today and wrote a Hello World program. Some keywords I learnt today include  Function, argument, bugs, debugging, variables and comments.

## Day 2 (25th September 2024)
I learned a bit more about string methods today e.g. strip, split, lsplit and split, and understood the difference between params and arguments. Built a very basic calculator. 


## Day 3 (26th September 2024)
I learned how to write my functions using the define keyword, and yes I use spaces, not tabs. Also got enlightened on the limitations of floats in contrast to integers.


## Day 4 (27th September 2024)
I learnt how to order functions using the main function so that the code is ordered according to my thought process. I also finished the week 0 lecture video.  

#### (28th September 2024)

## Day 5 (29th September 2024)

Did some revision of variables functions and return values in python 

## DAY 6 (30th September 2024)
I started with the week 1 lecture. I learnt about conditional statements in Python and control flow (a diagram expressing a program's logic). I Topped that off with Booleans. 

## Day 7: 1st  October  2024
I went deeper into conditionals and the modulo operator. Also understood how to make a function return a boolean value, which can be used by another function to do something.
