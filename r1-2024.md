# Plegding to embark on a 100 Days of Code Journey from 23rd September 2024


## Day 1
I started with the Cs50p course today. I decided not to skip any part even though I already know some basic Python.  I started with functions today and wrote a Hello World program. Some keywords I learnt today include  Function, argument, bugs, debugging, variables and comments.

## Day 2
I learned a bit more about string methods today e.g. strip, split, lsplit and split, and understood the difference between params and arguments. Built a very basic calculator. 


## Day 3
I learned how to write my functions using the define keyword, and yes I use spaces, not tabs. Also got enlightened on the limitations of floats in contrast to integers.
