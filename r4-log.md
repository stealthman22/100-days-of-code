## Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]

### Day 1
Built a password generator project originally made by Florin Pop's 100 days 100 projects challenge, and explained into details by Brad Traversy..
I got to learn more about objects, and the way the can be manipulated. Also learnt about the Unary operator. 
Next up is to make some custom changes to the project, as that is my new approach for this round. it's good to be back

## Restarted the challenge with new rules

### Day 1 (July 20 2020)
Went through some free code camp challenges, in my bid to understand vanilla js more. Focus was on manipulating objects using the Dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]).

### DAY 2 (July 21 2020)
Stayed so long at work, so couldn't do personal learning trying to secure our cms with an nginx reverse proxy, couldn't get the hand of it, so went with apache instead. Phew!


### DAY 3 (August 19 2020)

Went through some few Freecodecamp js challenges, was able to understand some key features of ES6 such as default parameters, and also how to chain ternary operators properly.


### DAY 4 (August 20 2020)

Spent time on my datascience setup using Anaconda, also played around with Spyder and Jupyter lab. It was amazing writing python code again.
Not sure of how to proceed, I hear miniconda is better suited.
