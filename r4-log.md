## Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]

### Day 1
Built a password generator project originally made by Florin Pop's 100 days 100 projects challenge, and explained into details by Brad Traversy..
I got to learn more about objects, and the way the can be manipulated. Also learnt about the Unary operator. 
Next up is to make some custom changes to the project, as that is my new approach for this round. it's good to be back
