## Log of Round 3 of #100DaysOfCode - Started on [Wednesday July 8th, 2020]

### Day 1
Built a password generator project originally made by Florin Pop's 100 days 100 projects challenge, and explained into details by Brad Traversy..
I got to learn more about objects, and the way the can be manipulated. Also learnt about the Unary operator. 
Next up is to make some custom changes to the project, as that is my new approach for this round. it's good to be back

## Restarted the challenge with new rules

### Day 1 (July 20 2020)
Went through some free code camp challenges, in my bid to understand vanilla js more. Focus was on manipulating objects using the Dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]).

### DAY 2 (July 21 2020)
Stayed so long at work, so couldn't do personal learning trying to secure our cms with an nginx reverse proxy, couldn't get the hand of it, so went with apache instead. Phew!


### DAY 3 (August 19 2020)

Went through some few Freecodecamp js challenges, was able to understand some key features of ES6 such as default parameters, and also how to chain ternary operators properly.


### DAY 4 (August 20 2020)

Spent time on my datascience setup using Anaconda, also played around with Spyder and Jupyter lab. It was amazing writing python code again.
Not sure of how to proceed, I hear miniconda is better suited.

### DAY 5 (August 21 2020)

Got to meet the Data science community on Kaggle, seems they've got really vast resources for data science and ml, decided to take their basic python course and work my way up. 

### DAY 6 (August 22 2020)

Didn't code much today, just played around a bit with Kaggle, watched some videos on the data science world and what's really needed in ds jobs, also viewed some job listings on LinkedIn and applied for a few.

### DAY 7 (August 23 2020)
Spent some time going through the python for data science refresher on Kaggle. Didn't finish the module yet but picked up some new things in functions, booleans and list. Would start participating in data problem sets soon.

### DAY 8 (August 24 2020)

Started a refresher in core vanilla js concepts. Focusing on how javascript works in the browser (working with the DOM). Using these amazing tutorials by Steve Griffith https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyuRouwmQCjmQTKvgqIgah03HF1wrYkA9

### DAY 9 - 12th  (25th - 28th August 2020)

Didn't record my progress on Day 9, and honestly didn't really do anything the other days. Apart from stuff I did on the side biz I've been working on, it does take a lot of time
Other personal things to take care of came up to.

### DAY 13 - 14 (29th - 30th August 2020)
No coding, just some planning

### DAY 14 (31st August 2020) 
Built a nice split landing page in html css and js. It's more like a basic representation of how I would want to build my next portfolio using route 

### DAY 15 (1st September 2020)
Tried to recreate the stylesheet of the split landing page, using flexbox, and reducing the use of position absolute, so it would be easier making it look nicer on mobile.
Encountered some problems which shows that position absolute is easier for specifically targetting positons, but not always advisable.

### DAY 16 (2nd September 2020)
Started revising my ds classes from WQU. Went through python classes:
- We use classes to perform related tasks that are repetitive
- functions in classes are called methods.

### Day 17 (3rd September 2020)
Revised input-output and file management in python. This allows you to be able to manipulate data stored in files via code.


### DAY 18 (4rd September 2020)

Did some introspecting about my coding career and the way forward at this point My aim is to arrive at a decision that makes me do what I enjoy and won't burn bridges at the same time.

### DAY 19 - 20 (5th - 6th september)

Did some introspecting, and decided to be building react projects, while improving in js.s. 


### DAY 21 (7th September)

I went through the official react docs and started building the tic-tac-toe game to give myself a refresher in react basics.


### DAY 22 (8th September)

Was able to finally finish up on the tic tac toe react game, seems to be working fine, and I learnt a lot, but still have questions about state and props.


### DAY 23 (9th September)

Did a little coding in react. And spent the rest of the day drawing up a contract agreement. Yes, I did say contract agreement, guess who just got his first freelance Client? I would be building a react app to manage learning between a community  and tutors  Which I would then incorporate a blog into (digging something simple with netlify cms and gatsby)  I am grateful for the opportunity to do this, and feel quite thrilled and scared at the same time :)

### DAY 24 (10th September)

Started building a react movie app, while following along Webinfalks course on Udemy. We will be using functional components with hooks, I think I kinda like the class syntax. 
Question on my mind is when to use hooks API or redux or both


### DAY 25 (11th September)

Structuring the state in my react movie app. Got introduced to the new hooks API. I think the biggest advantage is that you won't have to lift state anymore, just add it to wherever you want. I am gradually getting the hang of it.

### DAY 26 (12th September)

Started working on styled components. I think i really like how they work using the new tagged literals functionality.Being able to style nested elements. Also isolating media queries to one component at a time is awesome.





### DAY 27 (13th September)

Day off for me. Seems I am getting into the habbit of taking sundays off :) I do assist with the streaming and projection at church so...

### DAY 28 - 29 (14th - 15th September)

 Learnt to abstract the styled-components to separate files in a styles directory, this way my normal components stay neat, and in a way, it seems we are still able to keep the CSS separate from js.

Struggled through an import error, But finally importing data from the movie API
N.B: In react if you don't export with the  default keyword, ensure to import with a {}: import {exported stuff} from 'path-to-file' 


### DAY 30 (16th September)
 
Added the search functionality for the homepage, it entailed a whole lot of state manipulation and callbacks. Callback functions seem to have a special way they work in to react.
 
 
 ### DAY 31 - 42 (17th - 27th September)
 Haven't been posting for a while now, things have been a blur lately. In that time I have completed my react movie app, learnt a lot about states, prototypes, APIs. Would deploy it to Netlify and add new features with time, and also create a branch where I redo everything in class components... Also, I am really close to landing my first freelance contract; hence I've learnt a lot about handling clients: in relation to emotions, pricing, boldness and firmness.
 
 
 ### DAY 43 - 46 (28th  - 30th September)
 
  Started working through how the project I am working on should go; outlining the flow and reading up how others tackled theirs successfully.
 Also finished my react movie app and hosted on Netlify
 
 
 ### DAY 47- 48 (1st - 2nd October)
 
 Edited my portfolio page, added my new react movie app;
moviepal.netlify.app
 and a few other changes. I want it to also be recent
 Started a MongoDB crash course by Brad Traversy. Using both the command-line and mongo compass.  

 ### DAY 49 (3rd October)
 
 Finished Traversy's mongodb tutorial, and created my first atlas cluster
 Also started to learn how to run mongo using mongoose in actual node development,and how to run basic backedn tests in mocha.
